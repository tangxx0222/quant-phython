# quant-python

## introduction
This project is a collection of short python programs I wrote during bootcamp.

## python basics
we learned about python datatypes,
if-elif-else conditionals, for and while
loops, lists and tuples, and list
comprehensions.

Here is my [basics Jupyter Notebook] (https://github.com/tangxx0222/quant-phython/blob/master/python-basics-notebook.ipynb).
